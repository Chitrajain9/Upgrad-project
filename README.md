# Suicide Data Analysis and Prevention

This project involves the analysis of suicide data, identification of suicide clusters and hotspots based on historical trends and geographic locations, and the creation of a Suicide Helpline App for awareness and support.

## Overview

This project aims to analyze suicide data, identify potential hotspots, and contribute to suicide prevention. The code includes data processing, analysis, visualization, and the creation of a Suicide Helpline App.

## Data Analysis

The code analyzes suicide data, grouping it by state and identifying potential hotspots based on historical trends. It provides insights into gender, age group, causes of death, and trends over the years.

## Insights

The analysis yields insights into potential suicide hotspots, causes of death by gender and age group, distribution across age groups, and gender-wise comparisons. These insights are crucial for understanding and addressing suicide-related issues.

## Visualizations

The visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, and line charts to represent data patterns effectively. These visualizations help in presenting identified insights and trends visually.

## Suicide Helpline App

The project includes a simple Suicide Helpline App implemented in Tkinter. The app displays helpline numbers for different regions, providing immediate support for those in crisis.

To run the app:
```bash
python suicide_helpline_app.py
